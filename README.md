# Gemini API Demos

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ This is a repository of examples built with Google's Gemini API, which lets you build multimodal AI applications with text, images, and more.

## What You'll Find:

Examples: These demos show the latest Gemini models (Flash 1.5, Pro, and others) in action. Dive into projects that demonstrate:

- Image and Video understanding: Analyze content, classify objects, and even generate timestamped summaries.
- Multimodal interaction: Combine text and image inputs to create engaging user experiences.
- Technical Inspiration: Get hands-on with code examples that show you how to use the Gemini API effectively. Learn best practices for prompt engineering, caching and embedding, and integrating Gemini into your own applications.

## Getting Started:

1. Obtain an API Key: To use the Gemini API, you'll need an API key. You can get one [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) or from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Explore the Docs: The official documentation is your comprehensive guide to the Gemini API: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/
3. Dive into the Demos: Choose a demo that sparks your interest and follow the instructions in its README. You'll be up and running in no time!

## Important Notes:

1. API Usage Limits: Google may have usage limits and associated costs for the Gemini API. Be sure to review the details on their website.
2. Responsible AI: Please use the Gemini API responsibly and ethically. Avoid generating harmful or misleading content.
3. Feedback Welcome: We value your input! If you encounter issues, have suggestions, or want to share your creations, please open an issue or pull request.

| [Multimodal Embeddings](/multimodal-embeddings) | Using Gemini's new Multimodal Embeddings API, we'll explore high dimensional embedding space of text, images, and videos.                                                                                                                                                                     | [Multimodal Embeddings API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings), [Firestore Vector Search](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/vector-search) |
| [Gemini Video Scrubber](/video-scrubber)        | "GVS" is a prototype that uses Gemini's multimodal video understanding capabilities to create timestamped summaries of videos with a simple UI to play those timestamps back in sequence, giving you the ability to quickly scan videos for interesting moments, common occurences, and more! | Multimodal Gemini, File API, Caching                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [Voice Cursor](/voice-cursor)                    | An experimental text editor that lets you highlight phrases and instantly hear them spoken by Gemini 2.0 in different expressive styles.
